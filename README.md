Project Name: ATM System design using ESP32 and user interface as TelegrambOT ,Google sheets as user Database.
Resources: Arduino IDE , ESP32 ,TelegramBot,Google script.

The user bank data will present in Google sheet like named,password,Account balance and traction history.So ,I connected the ESP32 and Google sheet  using the code I written in Arduino IDE . 

And i connected the Telegram bot as userinterface to ESP32 which helps User to give Input or read Output produced by the ESP32.

When the user gives any commands in Telegram bot like add money to account or withdraw the money or user want to check available balance in his account,the commands will be read by the ESP32 and it performs accordingly.


I am done this project by using google sheets ,Telegram bot as user Interface and ESP32(IOT device).
